Description:
    Insatll the generator files.
    This is useful when you scaffold amdin ui, normally you would rails g scaffold admin/post,
    but this would generator so much unused files that you need to delete.
    you turn off some file's generation by specify your generators config in application.rb like this

    when generating admin templates, normally you don't need tests, helper, jubilder you can set it in config/application.rb

    # http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html#customizing-your-workflow-by-changing-generators-templates
    config.generators do |g|
     g.orm             false #active_record
     g.template_engine :haml #erb
     g.test_framework  :test_unit, fixture: true
     g.stylesheets     false
     g.javascripts     false
     g.assets          false
     g.helper          false
     g.jbuilder        false
    end

    and also you may need to custom the templates, the generators

Example:
    rails generate install:rails # This will copy lib/rails/generators in railtie gem to lib/generators
    rails generate install:haml # This will copy lib/generators in haml-rails gem to lib/generators
    rails generate install:inherited_resources # This will copy lib/generators gem in inherited_sources to lib/generators
