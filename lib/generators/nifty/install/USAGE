Description:
    Copy the generator files to lib/generators, so you can customize !
    This is useful when you scaffold amdin ui, normally you would run rails g scaffold admin/post,
    but this would generate so many files that you may don't need.
    so you turn off these file's generation by specify your generators config in application.rb like this

    when scaffolding admin interface, normally you don't need tests, helper, jubilder files generator, you can disable it in config/application.rb.

    config.generators do |g|
      g.orm                   false # active_record, set this to false to disable model file generation when scaffold admin ui
      g.template_engine       :haml # erb
      # g.test_framework      :test_unit, fixture: true
      # g.test_framework      :rspec
      g.test_framework        nil
      g.stylesheets           false
      g.javascripts           false
      g.assets                false
      g.helper                false
      g.jbuilder              false
    end

    and also you may need to customize the templates, the generators .....
    for more you can read http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html#customizing-your-workflow-by-changing-generators-templates or source code

Example:
    rails g nifty:install                     # Print this message
    rails g nifty:install:rails               # This will copy lib/rails/generators in railtie gem to lib/generators
    rails g nifty:install:haml_rails          # This will copy lib/generators in haml-rails gem to lib/generators
    rails g nifty:install:rspec-rails          # This will copy lib/generators in haml-rails gem to lib/generators
    rails g nifty:install:simple_form         # This will copy lib/generators gem in simple_form to lib/generators
    rails g nifty:install:factory_girl_rails  # This will copy lib/generators gem in factory_girl_rails to lib/generators
    rails g nifty:install:inherited_resources # This will copy lib/generators gem in inherited_sources to lib/generators
